# UnityBowlingProject
A fairly simple bowling game written in Unity.

Currently includes a working bowling game with high score system, with a challenge mode soon to be added
that will include obstacles and certain pin formations, similar to Wii Sports Bowling's training mode.

If you would like to investigate the C# coding/scripting, please see Assets/RegularBowlingAssets/Scripts
